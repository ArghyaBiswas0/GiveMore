A donation-based marketplace for essential supplies that focuses on community cooperation through which donors can donate surplus supplies they have to the financially underprivileged, medical workers and also NGOs and hospitals. Built using the Flutter framework for cross-platform support and we have used Firebase for backend services. IBM Watson virtual assistant built-in to answer all queries related to COVID and help distributors in navigation.  
Distributors will be picking up these supplies from donors and delivering them to the donees. Allows us to create temporary employment for the unemployed and also respect principles of social distancing.
